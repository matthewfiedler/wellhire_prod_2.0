          Free Trial Usage
        </h5>
        <p>
          By registering for a free trial membership, you will have unlimited access to all features of the Wellhire service for
          days, with your free trial ending on
          by visiting the MY ACCOUNT tab, and selecting CANCEL MY ACCOUNT. If you wish to continue using the Wellhire service, simply refrain from cancelling your account and you will continue to enjoy unlimited access to all Wellhire features; your account will then be billed on a monthly basis until you decide to cancel your account.

          All candidate tests completed during the free trial period are considered free, and do not count towards your ongoing membership. If you do not cancel your account prior to the end of the free trial, you will be charged standard member pricing.
